    cd upskill-recommender
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory (if you have one)
    # cd backend 

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install npm packages
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables**
    *   In the root of the backend directory, create a `.env` file and add your API key:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
        ```
    *   In the `frontend` directory, create a `.env.local` file to point to your local backend:
