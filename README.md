*   Python 3.9+
*   Node.js & npm (or your preferred package manager)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/upskill-recommender.git
    cd upskill-recommender
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory (if you have one)
    # cd backend 

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install npm packages
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables**
    *   In the root of the backend directory, create a `.env` file and add your API key:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
        ```
    *   In the `frontend` directory, create a `.env.local` file to point to your local backend:
        ```
        VITE_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Backend Server**
    In your backend directory, with the virtual environment activated:
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can explore the interactive docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

2.  **Run the Frontend App**
    In a separate terminal, from the `frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified by Vite) in your browser to see the application.
